### Why is there no light theme?

I take care of the eyes of potential people that visits the website. If you want to make a light theme, feel free to do
so.

### Can I open pull requests and contribute?

You *can*, however it's highly doubtful that I will merge them.

### Can I copy and paste this on my website?

Yes! You will need to keep the copyright notice in the footer like the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) says >.<<br>In case you
use it you can always give it a star 🌟
